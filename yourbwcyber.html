    <section class="article-content">
      <p><span class="firste">E</span>ver got off a conversation on the phone with your friends or spouse about an issue or anything at all, only for you to enter apps like Instagram or tiktok and see content relating to the conversation you just had? well it's not a coincidence because <b>you are being monitored</b>, yes tech companies have it in place to collect information about you and use it to display ad content based on your preferences, but are they doing much more than just data collection for target ads?</p>
      <p>Here are some secrets tech companies and the government don't want you to know... </p>
      <h2>Your Phone May be listening to you.</h2>
      <p>
         This is probably something you might have heard before and thought it was a myth, well i'm here to reveal to you that it's not! (Don't take my word for it). Yes your phone maybe listening to your daily conversation with people around you, it doesn't have to be a phone call or voice note you sent on WhatsApp probably, it could be a physical conversation you had or the meeting you attended.
         </p>
        <p> All these data collection are intended to create a more subtle profile on you, social media companies also corporate with some phone brands in other to get that data, for the purpose of displaying targeted content, which also explains why your social media "for you" page always know what you want.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Your Webcam maybe watching you</h2>
       <p> A video call with a friend or a loved one may sounds fun because it's a two-sided thing you know, imagine when it's one-sided and to make matters worse, your not even aware of a call in the first place.That's probably what companies in power could do to your webcam.</p>
       
       <p>
           In February 2010, school officials in southeastern Pennsylvania installed a software on school laptops that allowed them to activate students’ Webcams remotely. They claimed that it was purposed to find stolen laptops, but the parents didn't buy those claims and sued the district. The story made international headlines.
       </p>
       <p>A few weeks ago, a girl on tiktok complained that she was being <b>anonymously blackmailed</b> by someone who apparently had pictures of her, "nude and widespread" in front of her laptop, she claimed she didn't send a nude to anyone and doesn't understand how that picture even existed, probably a stalker who had access to her webcam.</p>
       <p>
           There are still tons of other stories linked to how your webcam can be your biggest spy yet and how your privacy isn't fully ensured.
       </p>
       <br>
       <h2>Your Anti-virus software is just a big spy app in disguise</h2>
       <p>
           It only makes sense to install an Anti-virus software to prevent malware attacks or some chinese hacker  trying to take over your life (phone).
       </p>
       <p>
           An <em style="font-weight:bold;">Anti-virus software</em> is actually intended to prevent malware attacks, they'll alert you anytime you visit a site that has been reported to be malicious or when they notice any suspicious activity. This alone should bring us to one good question, <b>how exactly does my Anti-virus work?</b>
       </p>
        <p>
            <b>Anti-virus softwares</b> are installed as regular software and just sit in the background of the device to monitor and check for anomalies. Some of them need access to monitor your screen to ensure "smooth operation" of the software, but what does this actually mean? it means they are <b>monitoring your every move</b>, from the videos you watch, to the websites you regularly visit even down to your messages even before you send them! (since they also monitor screen activity).<br>
            This might make you wonder if you really want to give them all that access to your privacy.
        </p>
        <br>

      </blockquote>
       <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>There are so much more instances of how modern tech companies could easily profile you, how the Government could arrest you for a crime you commited in your dream, and also how Facebook literally knows what's on your mind. The awareness of unending possibilities is crucial to someone living in this modern age, as its better to be informed so you won't be taking by surprise.</p>
